# GoViolin
A dockerized go web app where the build is automated by a jenkins pipeline

The docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/ahero12317/goviolin

the pipeline is hosted on the localhost so remote building won't work

here's a gif of the build process

I've omitted the part where the docker image is pushed since it takes time to upload it
